# Codex Context: GPU-Reseller

## Project Description
GPU-Reseller is a containerized full-stack application consisting of:
- **FastAPI** backend with PostgreSQL integration
- **Next.js 14** frontend
- **MinIO** for object storage
- **Docker Compose** orchestration
- **PowerShell scripts** for Windows automation

## Codex Behavior
When asked for help:
- Always read compose.yaml, api/, web/, and docs/notes.md.
- Keep solutions Windows-compatible.
- Prefer PowerShell for automation tasks.
- Maintain cross-platform (Linux/macOS) compatibility when possible.
- Ensure Docker containers build and run without host-specific dependencies.
- Preserve all working environment variables (especially NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE).

## Current Goals
1. Extend API with authentication and user management.
2. Add dashboard visualization for GPU metrics.
3. Harden Docker networking and environment checks.
4. Implement CI/CD readiness (optional future task).

## Style Guide
- FastAPI routes: concise, typed, and documented.
- Next.js components: functional, clean, minimal CSS.
- Use `.env` for secrets, never hardcode credentials.
- Commit messages: short and descriptive.

## Automation Commands
- When user says “version bump” or “milestone reached”, run:
  `scripts/version-bump.ps1`
